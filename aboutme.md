### My story

Professionally, I'm a scientist formally trained in multiple disciplines. In addition to my geospatial experience, I've spent time both in a cancer research laboratory and doing field research studying butterflies in the Tetons. I have Master of Science degrees: one in Genetics, the other in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, both from Iowa State University. When not geeking out over GIS data, I can be found hiking the beautiful Arizona landscapes and hanging with my two crazy Border Collie-ish dogs, Oskar and Mazy.
